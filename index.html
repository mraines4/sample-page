      <p>My name is Matt Raines and I have many passions:</p>

          <li>Family</li>
          <li>Friends</li>

      <p>I am a 28 year old husband (and soon to be father) residing in Acworth, GA. I was born in Walnut Creek, CA and lived in the San Francisco Bay Area until 2001 when I moved to Georgia.</p>
      <p>I attended Auburn University for two years before transferring back home to Kennesaw State University where I earned my Bachelors of Business Administration in Professional Sales. I spent 9 years as an inside account manager and sign designer during and after college at my families wholesale sign company before leaving in December 2017. From there I went on to be a field sales representative for a commercial roofing manufacturer.</p> 
      <p>In 2016, I married the love of my life (Chelsey) and we are expecting our first child in April 2019. We are having a boy and naming him Judah.</p> 
      <p>About 8 months ago, through the help of my family, I realized I have a real passion and knack for technology. Two of my brother-in-laws have recently changed careers and attended <a href="https://digitalcrafts.com">DigitalCrafts</a> so I decided it was time for me to look into it as well to see if it would be a good fit for me. I cannot wait to hone in on my passion and make it a career. I am excited for what the future holds.</p>
